I've built a skateboarding website that lets users buy trendy skate gear and access cool skateboarding tutorials via online videos.
To boost user experience, I've incorporated key elements like a navigation bar, footer, carousels, modals, embedded videos, pop-up modals, and Font Awesome icons. This blend of features and tech guarantees an engaging and user-friendly experience for skateboarding enthusiasts.
Language & Libraries used - This development involved HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, JSON and the responsive Bootstrap grid system.
